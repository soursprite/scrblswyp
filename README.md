This is a proof of concept note app to simulate how I take paper notes

To be written in React with a Node and MongoDB backend

I will fill a page with Todos

If a task requires priority attention, I circle them

If a task really requires attention, I REALLY circle them lol

When a task is done, they are crossed out.

when my page is full, i transfer any incomplete tasks to a new sheet of paper

some tasks have subtasks, which i will annotate below or to the side
